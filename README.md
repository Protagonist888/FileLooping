# Dataframe creation through Excel looping in python
A repo of file looping projects

First project description:

This code loops through all AEO Price files in a single folder location and creates one harmonized dataframe with all prices. Reads excel input. Splits data into three different dataframes, manipulates and creates unique fields and concats all dataframes back together
